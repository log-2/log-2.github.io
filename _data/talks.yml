      title: "Credible Decentralized Exchange Design via Verifiable Sequencing Rules"
      abstract: "    Trading on decentralized exchanges has been one of the primary use cases for permissionless blockchains with daily trading volume exceeding billions of U.S.~dollars. In the status quo, users broadcast transactions and miners are responsible for composing a block of transactions and picking an execution ordering -- the order in which transactions execute in the exchange. Due to the lack of a regulatory framework, it is common to observe miners exploiting their privileged position by front-running transactions and obtaining risk-fee profits. In this work, we propose to modify the interaction between miners and users and initiate the study of {\em verifiable sequencing rules}. As in the status quo, miners can determine the content of a block; however, they commit to respecting a sequencing rule that constrains the execution ordering and is verifiable (there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify if the execution ordering satisfies such constraints). Thus in the event a miner deviates from the sequencing rule, anyone can generate a proof of non-compliance. We ask if there are sequencing rules that limit price manipulation from miners in a two-token liquidity pool exchange. Our first result is an impossibility theorem: for any sequencing rule, there is an instance of user transactions where the miner can obtain non-zero risk-free profits. In light of this impossibility result, our main result is a verifiable sequencing rule that provides execution price guarantees for users. In particular, for any user transaction A, it ensures that either (1) the execution price of A is at least as good as if A was the only transaction in the block, or (2) the execution price of A is worse than this ``standalone'' price and the miner does not gain (or lose) when including A in the block."
      bio: "Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He holds a PhD (2022) and a MA (2018) in Computer Science from Princeton University and a BS in Computer Engineering (2016) from the Federal University of Itajubá. His primary research interests are in market design, algorithmic economics, cryptography, and information security. He is particularly interested in how one can build trust by building platforms that have the incentive to follow their own specification. For example, auctions are the main building block of how we transact on eBay or how Google sells advertising; however, it is impossible to know whether or not a self-interested auctioneer is also shill bidding, i.e., bidding in their auction with a fake identity. His research shows this kind of manipulation is not inevitable, and one can design auctions that are credible by design."

      title: "Neural Algorithmic Reasoning"
      abstract: "Neural networks that are able to reliably execute algorithmic computation may hold transformative potential to both machine learning and theoretical computer science. On one hand, they could enable the kind of extrapolative generalisation scarcely seen with deep learning models. On another, they may allow for running classical algorithms on inputs previously considered inaccessible to them. Both of these promises are shepherded by the neural algorithmic reasoning blueprint, which has been recently proposed in a position paper I co-authored with Charles Blundell. On paper, this is a remarkably elegant pipeline for reasoning on natural inputs which carefully leverages the tried-and-tested power of deep neural networks as feature extractors. In practice, how far did we actually take it? In this tutorial, we aim to provide the foundations needed to answer three key questions of neural algorithmic reasoning: how to develop neural networks that execute algorithmic computation, how to deploy such neural networks in real-world problems, and how to deepen their theoretical links to classical algorithms."

      title: "Pack your subgraphs - A journey into subgraphs for powerful Graph Neural Networks"
      abstract: "Whilst considered the leading architectures for Deep Learning on graph-structured data, Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are intrinsically bounded in their expressive power by the WL heuristic for graph isomorphism testing - a limitation that has recently ignited prolific research aiming at breaking this fundamental bottleneck. Yet, the most prominent approaches either suffer from high computational complexity and weak inductive biases or require some form of domain knowledge for their effective application. In this talk - which I structure in two parts - I will argue that these aforementioned limitations can be mitigated by resorting to a principled modelling of subgraphs. We will first observe that graphs not distinguishable by MPNNs often contain distinguishable subgraphs. In the first part of the talk, we will build upon this intuition to design a novel framework dubbed Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN), prescribing to represent a graph as a bag of subgraphs returned by a pre-specified policy and to process it with a suitable equivariant architecture. We show that this approach effectively increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures, and study the impact of its design choices. Interestingly, we notice a surge in concurrent approaches which - sometimes unwittingly - make use of subgraphs for powerful graph representations. In the second part of the talk we will focus on the most prominent form of these methods: those where subgraphs are directly “generated” by nodes in the original graph (node-based methods). A novel symmetry analysis allows to unify and better characterise this class of approaches: we prove an upper-bound on their expressive power and conceive a framework serving as a design space for equivariant node-based subgraph architectures. Finally, we introduce a novel instantiation of this framework: a new method dubbed SUN, which captures previous architectures while providing better empirical performance on multiple benchmarks."
